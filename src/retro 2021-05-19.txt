What went well
- (most of) PRs that only need minor corrections are now approved and can be merged by the team the next day
- daily meetings are better (shorter and more focused)

What could have been better
- all PRs that only need minor...
- make a habit out of checking own PRs at EOD to make sure that they are in the correct state (eg: ready for review)
- dedicated channel for important internal stuff
- very difficult to follow threads on webex - need to scroll up a lot
- having more permissions on webex repos would help (eg: remove the protected branch flag, run CI, inspect configurations)
- permission to merge simple PRs (eg: updating a dependency's version OR simple bug fixes)
- daily meetings should be even shorter
- in daily, each dev should have a turn of maximum 5 minutes
- have a "retro prep" meeting in Romanian before the real retro to better collect feedback
- have a re-estimation session before closing the sprint. Q: should we update the SPs? maybe at the next daily after closing a story
